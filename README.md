# WIP

This is a just a work in progress at this stage exploring the viability of the idea. 99% of the cases are easily covered but there are some issues arround type definition order depedencies and mutually recursive types that will require a lot more work.

## TODO
- [ ] Type Decleration Emit Order
- [ ] Mutually Recursive Types
- [ ] Objects with a mix of required and non required fields
